# Unity graphics
This repository is my playground for learning graphics programming.
At the moment it contains 2 Unity packages, a modified HDRP and Dynamic Grass.

The modified HDRP has better bloom and volumetric rainbows

Dynamic Grass renders grass

Better readme coming soon, but this is better than it as before anyway
