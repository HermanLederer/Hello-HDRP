# Unity graphics
This repository is my playground for learning graphics programming.
At the moment it contains 2 Unity packages, modified HDRP and Dynamic Grass.
## Modified HDRP
List of changes to the HDRP:
1) Better bloom
2) Volumetric rainbows
3) Purkinje effect
4) Negative afterimage
5) Eyelids and squinting
## Dynamic Grass
Renders grass. *insert some gifs here*

Better readme coming soon, but this is better than it was before anyway.
