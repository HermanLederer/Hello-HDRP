# Unity graphics
This repository is my playground for learning graphics programming.
At the moment it contains 2 Unity packages, modified HDRP and Dynamic Grass.

Modified HDRP has better bloom and volumetric rainbows.

Dynamic Grass renders grass.

Better readme coming soon, but this is better than it was before anyway.
