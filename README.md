At the moment it contains 2 Unity packages, modified HDRP and Dynamic Grass.
## Modified HDRP
List of changes to the HDRP:
1) Better bloom *insert some gifs here*
2) Volumetric rainbows *insert some gifs here*
3) Purkinje effect *insert some gifs here*
4) Negative afterimage *insert some gifs here*

Better readme coming soon, but this is better than it was before anyway.
